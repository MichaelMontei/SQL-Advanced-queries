### The syntax: learning SQL
This [basic MySQL tutorial](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/basic-mysql-tutorial.aspx) explains some basic SQL statements. If this is the first time you have used a relational database management system, this tutorial teaches you everything you need to know to work with MySQL such as querying data, updating data, managing databases, and creating tables.

This is a selection of all interesting and common used ways of reading data out MySQL.
With the knowledge you will gain here, you will be able to answer all questions below!

1. Querying data
